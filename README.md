# Correlating Stock Price Movements with US Election News Coverage

## **1. Project Overview**

This project aims to find a correlation between stock price movements of a given subset of companies and news coverage related to US elections. Specifically, the goal is to identify:
- Stocks that benefit from increased winning chances of Democrats.
- Stocks that benefit from increased winning chances of Republicans.

The pipeline will use **PySpark**, **Spark Streaming**, **Kafka**, and various APIs to collect, process, and analyze data in real-time.

## **2. Selected Subset of Stocks**

We will focus on stocks that are historically sensitive to political changes, or are topics of debate in the current election cycle. The selected subset includes:

- **Healthcare Sector**: UnitedHealth Group, Pfizer.
- **Energy Sector**: 
  - Renewable Energy (Democrats): First Solar, NextEra Energy.
  - Fossil Fuels (Republicans): ExxonMobil, Chevron.
- **Social Media Platforms**: Truth Social (Trump Media & Technology Group), Twitter.
- **Crypto Sector**: Coinbase, Bitcoin, MicroStrategy.
- **Defense Contractors**: Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies.
- **Financial Institutions**: JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs.

## **4. Data Pipeline Design**

### a. Kafka Data Ingestion
- **Kafka Topics**:
  - `news-stream`: For streaming news articles.
  - `stock-prices`: For real-time stock price data.
- **Kafka Producers**:
  - **News Producer**: Fetches and publishes news articles to `news-stream`.
  - **Stock Price Producer**: Fetches and publishes stock prices to `stock-prices`.

### b. Spark Streaming Jobs
- **News Consumer**: 
  - Processes news data for sentiment analysis.
  - Tags articles with entities (Democrat, Republican).
- **Stock Price Consumer**: 
  - Processes stock price movements in real-time.

### c. Sentiment Analysis
- Clean and tokenize the text data.
- Perform sentiment analysis using NLP libraries.
- Classify articles as positive, negative, or neutral for Democrats or Republicans.

### d. Correlate Sentiment with Stock Movements
- Align sentiment scores with corresponding stock price data based on timestamps.
- Perform statistical analysis (correlation coefficients, regression models) to identify relationships.

---

## **5. Infrastructure Setup**

### a. Environment Setup
- **Cluster Setup**:
  - AWS EMR, Google Dataproc, or local Hadoop cluster.
- **Technologies**:
  - Kafka for data ingestion.
  - Spark for stream processing.
  - HDFS or S3 for data storage.

### b. Spark and Kafka Configuration
- Install Kafka and configure brokers.
- Write Kafka producers to fetch data from APIs and publish to Kafka topics.
- Write Spark Streaming applications to process data and perform sentiment analysis.

### c. Data Storage
- Use **HDFS** or **S3** for batch data processing.
- Use a database like **Cassandra** or **MongoDB** for real-time access.
